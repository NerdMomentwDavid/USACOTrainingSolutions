# USACOTrainingSolutions
C++ solutions to USACO training site

(I hope people actually read this...)

Please understand that these solutions are all written by me and if you simply copy it you won't learn anything. I suggest that you read over the codes and try to comprehend what I did. (also feel free to add improvisations to the codes because mine might not be the most efficient one) I have explainations of the codes on my youtube so if you are stuck you can watch some of my videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNcKbPw9hrV01NtIa0qktHQ
